		Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a free software distributed operating system. <br><br>

		It was developed primarily for research purposes as the successor to Unix by the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs between the mid-1980s and 2002. <br><br>

		Plan 9 continues to be used and developed by operating system researchers and hobbyists.<br><br>

		Plan 9 has novel features such as the 9P protocol for accessing local and remote resources as files, union mounts, an improved proc file system, and native unicode support throughout the system. <br><br>

		In Plan 9, all system interfaces, including those required for networking and the user interface, are represented through the file system rather than specialized interfaces.<br><br>
